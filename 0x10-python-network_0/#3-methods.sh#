```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept

# Check if the user provided a URL argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <URL>"
    exit 1
fi

# Send an OPTIONS request to the URL and display the allowed methods
curl -sI -X OPTIONS "$1" | grep -i "allow" | awk '{print $2}'
```

This script takes a URL as an argument, sends an OPTIONS request to that URL using `curl`, extracts the allowed methods from the response headers, and then displays them. Make sure to run it with the desired URL as an argument, for example:

```bash
./3-methods.sh http://0.0.0.0:5000/route_4
```

This will display the allowed HTTP methods for the specified URL.
